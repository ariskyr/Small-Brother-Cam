# Small-Brother-Cam

DIY project for a security cam using ESP32-Cam Module

## Prerequisites

I am using the ESP-IDF framework to develop the firmware for the ESP32-Cam module. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html).
Also using the VSCode extension to make my life easier, it provides a bunch of tasks to build, flash, monitor, etc. I won't be explaining how they work here, check the espressif docs.

I am also on Windows but I would work on Linux if I could, but I can't so I won't :).

## Hardware

TODO: Add the hardware list

## Software

TODO: figure out how to enable syntax highlighting, (probably just need to enable compile_commands.json) and install clangd server on windows
TODO: enable clang format as well
TODO: clear the vscode extensions that I dont need
TODO: figure out how everything works, I am a caveman pressing buttons for now
